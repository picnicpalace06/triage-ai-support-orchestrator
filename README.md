## Build

A terminal-based agent that, for each row in `support_tickets/support_tickets.csv`, produces:

| Column         | Allowed values                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`       | `replied`, `escalated`                                  |
| `product_area` | most relevant support category / domain area            |
| `response`     | user-facing answer grounded in the provided corpus      |
| `justification`| concise explanation of the routing/answering decision   |
| `request_type` | `product_issue`, `feature_request`, `bug`, `invalid`    |

Hard requirements (from `problem_statement.md`):

- Must be **terminal-based**.
- Must use **only the provided support corpus** (no live web calls for ground-truth answers).
- Must **escalate** high-risk, sensitive, or unsupported cases instead of guessing.
- Must avoid hallucinated policies or unsupported claims.

Submissions are scored across four dimensions: agent design (your `code/`), the AI Judge interview, output accuracy on `support_tickets/output.csv`, and AI fluency from your chat transcript.

See [`evalutation_criteria.md`](./evalutation_criteria.md) for the full rubric.
